Architecture

Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?

In this class, we used HTML, Javascript, and SPA. All of these componenets helped us develop a web application that allowed customers to view, book, and edit specific vacations. All of these components brought a different factor to the operation of the application. We used MongoDB because it was the easiest and most secure way to create the program. 

Functionality

How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.

JSON is a standard way for data to be read in javascript. It allows the program to take the data and transfer it into an object. The way that this works with javascript is that it allows the data to be used on the back end in a certain way, and used on the front end in a completely different way. The code is refractored to help increase the functionality and efficiency of the program. 

Testing

Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.

Using the localhost really helped see how secure the code and program was. It allowed me to see how the data is being loaded into the program. Postman was used to test the HTTP request. The methods for the program included GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. These different functions allowed to user to complete the tasks that they were looking to complete. 

Reflection

How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?

This course has really been challenging but extremely beneficial for me. I am hoping to one day get into the field of web design and creation.
